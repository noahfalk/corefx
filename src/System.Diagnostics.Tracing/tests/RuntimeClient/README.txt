This source is temporarily being copied from:
https://github.com/dotnet/diagnostics/tree/master/src/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tools.RuntimeClient

The intent is to improve that source, publish it as a NuGet package and refer to it the same way we are using TraceEvent. But
until that happens this is an easy workaround.
